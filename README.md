# Product Page

This is a product page, which by the way can be used as a product landing page.

The page is made by html, css and javascript. This is just to show how a page like this can be made by basic styles and vanilla javascript.

A more complex page should have a link to a cart, that displays the total quantity and price, plus a button for checkout or buy.

For the quantity, I have opted for a number input, that one can read the value from to calculate the total cost. Another way is to use a div that has arrows for up and down `(code commented)`, the logic would be to add event listeners to add or minus the quantity by 1 then calculate the total. Among the cons for using a div is the user will have no way of editing the value unless by arrows, and when you use the contentEditable, then you will have to use logic to restrict the use of NAN. Its easier to use a number input.

There will be a more complex version of this project were there will be a cart to simulate real life cart implementation.
